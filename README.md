In this project, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of four distinct machine learning and deep learning models—k-nearest neighbors (KNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), decision tree, and random forest—using the FER2013 dataset, which is aimed at recognizing human emotions through facial expressions.
One can download the dataset and can run the codes via Google Collab or Jupyter.
